# haskell-paints
Additional colours for Haskell

## examples
To build examples, one needs diagrams package with png, see makefile in examples folder...

## TODO

The idea is to give functions that can sort list of colors by their brightness, their hue or make a
shuffle bright-dark-bright-dark etc.

The same via attributes: get2 Dark Contrast 0 :: (Colour..., Colour...); Dark, Darkest, Light,
Lightest, Medium
VeryLigh
